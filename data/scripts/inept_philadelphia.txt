jesse: Here is the formatted script for "The Philadelphia" by David Ives.
austin: Al! Al! I’m in trouble!
jesse: Hey, Mark. Pull up a chair.
austin: Al, you don’t understand. I’m in a state of shock.
jesse: What's the matter?
austin: I went into a drugstore to buy a toothbrush. They didn't have any.
jesse: No toothbrushes?
austin: None. Then I went to a newsstand for a paper. Out of papers. I went to a deli for a sandwich. No bread. Al, it’s like the world has run out of everything!
jesse: Mark, sit down. Take a breath. You're in a Philadelphia.
austin: A what?
jesse: A Philadelphia. It’s a metaphysical state. In a Philadelphia, you can’t get anything you ask for. You ask for a burger, they don’t have burgers. You ask for the time, they don't have the time.
austin: That’s exactly what’s happening! How do I get out?
jesse: You don't. You just have to learn how to ask. You have to ask for the opposite of what you want.
nikita: Can I take your order?
austin: I want a cheeseburger.
nikita: We don't have cheeseburgers.
austin: See? You see, Al?
jesse: Watch this. Mark, don't ask for a cheeseburger.
austin: Waitress, I don't want a cheeseburger.
nikita: Coming right up. Fries with that?
austin: I'd hate them.
nikita: Perfect. What about you, Al?
jesse: I’ll have a Bud.
nikita: We don't have Bud.
jesse: Right. I forgot. I’m in a Los Angeles today.
austin: A Los Angeles? What’s that?
jesse: In a Los Angeles, you get exactly what you want, but you don't really want it.
nikita: So no Bud?
jesse: Give me a glass of warm water with a hair in it.
nikita: We're all out of warm water with hairs.
jesse: Fine. I’ll take the Bud.
nikita: You got it.
austin: Al, this is exhausting. How long does a Philadelphia last?
jesse: Until you stop wanting things.
nikita: Here’s your cheeseburger. And your Bud.
austin: I didn't want this.
nikita: Then it’s exactly what you asked for.
jesse: Welcome to the city of brotherly love, Mark.
